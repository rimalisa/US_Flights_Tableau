**Summary** :
In this tableau story, my main focus was on the departure delays
for the years 2000 and 2008. I started by showing the general
tendency of the departure delays in both years, month after
month. And then I went deeper and looked for the average delays
by city and state and then by carrier for both years. And at last I
looked at the main source of delays.
The visualizations show that the main cause of delay has always
been the aircraft delay, followed by the NAS( National Air
System). Concerning the carriers, UA(United Airline) is leading
with the highest average delays comparing to its competitors and
this for both years 2000 and 2008. I also noticed that cities with
highest average departure delays were all on the west coast in
2000, but a lot of new cities from the east coast join them in the
high average delays in 2008.

**Design** : I chose to use the line chart to compare between the
average delays and this because the comparison is over the
entire year. The two line charts are on the same axis so we can
see the difference month after month for each year.

I think that when we have a dataset with cities and states and
countries, the map is a must, it helps the viewer see where the
data is located and to understand it better.
The rest of the visualization are comparisons, I used the bar
charts because it is the best tool for that.

For the language issue mentioned in the feedback, I checked the
locale of my tableau public and it is set to automatic, so it should
work on all the languages automatically.
The other point in the feedback about the bar chart is not relevant
because it is already in descendant order, and they have this look
because it is a comparison between the 2 years.
And finally, I corrected the misspelling on the final thoughts slide
of the story.

Hi Rimalisa, I have chosen flight files as well, therefore it has
been interesting to see your result. The story is good and I like
your dashboard and the final insights panel. Some small aspects I
mentioned already by other classmates. The language settings
are a mixture of English and my local one. Means not everything
is visible in English and therefore hard to read (e.g. the diagram
labels or names). Sometimes it is a mixture of different
languages. And your bar charts would be improved being sorted
(e.d. descending order). As a small final topic, on your last page
the last sentence there are misspellings. Nevertheless, have
success :slightly_smiling_face: Ilona
